  <h1>Hi, I’m Andrew</h1>
  <p>I’m an Electrical Engineering student at Purdue University. I’m currently exploring embedded systems, RF, power electronics, and the intersection of software with hardware tooling.</p>
  <p>This blog is where I document projects, research notes, and experiments—complete with mistakes and measurements.</p>
